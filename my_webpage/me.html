    Rhode Island, the littlest State in the Union is where I call home. I work at the East Providence Career and Technical Center. 
    I coach the girls Cross Country team along with the boys High School Track & Field.  
    Can't forget that I also coach the middle school boys and girls track & Field teams.  I am a SkillsUSA Advisor
    and I really enjoy running, coaching, learning and most importantly my family.
